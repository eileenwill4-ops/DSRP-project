Structured water quality data for 41,000+ U.S. ZIP codes, derived from 50+ federal and state sources including EPA SDWIS, EPA ECHO, UCMR5, Consumer Confidence Reports (CCR), state MCL databases, CDC blood lead, FEMA flood claims, FEMA NRI, Census ACS, USGS groundwater, NOAA AirNow, CPSC recalls, and more. This water-quality slice is part of ZipCheckup's broader 17-vertical home-safety platform covering 278,000+ pages on zipcheckup.com. Each record includes violation history, lead and copper sampling results, PFAS detections, radon zone classification, flood risk, and a composite Home Safety Score. The dataset is designed for researchers, developers, journalists, and data scientists who need machine-readable, ZIP-level water quality data without building their own EPA data pipeline. Also available on-chain via API3 Airnode oracle.

## Supplementary Datasets

### ccr-enriched.csv — Consumer Confidence Reports

### state-mcl-crossref.json — State vs. Federal MCL Comparison

Cross-reference of measured contaminant levels against state-specific Maximum Contaminant Limits (MCLs) that are stricter than federal EPA limits. Covers CA, NJ, MA, NH, VT, CT, HI, and NM.

- **199 systems** with CCR data analyzed
- **201 comparisons** across contaminants and states
- **22 systems** fail their state MCL while passing the federal limit

Key fields per comparison: `pwsid`, `system_name`, `state`, `contaminant`, `measured`, `federal_mcl`, `state_mcl`, `unit`, `passes_federal`, `fails_state`, `zip_codes`, `notes`.

Notable findings:
- California enforces secondary manganese standard as a primary MCL — several large utilities exceed it
- New Jersey has a 1,4-dioxane MCL recommendation (0.33 ppb) not yet formally adopted
- Massachusetts and Vermont use composite PFAS standards (sum of multiple compounds)

### anomalies.json — Pattern Anomalies

| Anomaly Type | Count | Description |
|-------------|-------|-------------|
| `enforcement-spike` | 5,662 | Sudden increase in enforcement actions |
| `score-contradiction` | 3,051 | Score inconsistent with underlying data signals |
| `pfas-cluster` | 1,207 | Adjacent ZIPs with PFAS exceedances suggesting shared source |
| `island-of-safety` | 544 | Clean ZIP surrounded by high-risk neighbors |
| `silent-danger` | 667 | High risk indicators but no official violations |
| `wealth-paradox` | 633 | High-income area with poor water quality |
| `school-zone-risk` | 133 | Elevated risk near schools |
| `double-burden` | 10 | Low income + poor water quality |

## API Access

Single-ZIP JSON records are available via the ZipCheckup public API:

```bash
# Get data for a specific ZIP code
curl https://api.zipcheckup.com/v1/zip/90210

# Score only (lightweight)
curl https://api.zipcheckup.com/v1/zip/90210/score

# Rankings — best and worst ZIPs
curl "https://api.zipcheckup.com/v1/rankings?limit=10&order=asc"
```

Full API documentation: [api.zipcheckup.com/v1/](https://api.zipcheckup.com/v1/)

The per-ZIP API response includes additional fields not present in the flat dataset: full violation history, multiple water systems serving the ZIP, and recent violation details.

## Use Cases

- **Real estate applications** — surface water quality risk alongside walk scores and school ratings
- **Health research** — correlate ZIP-level water quality with health outcomes, demographics, or income data
- **Investigative journalism** — identify ZIP codes with persistent unresolved violations or elevated lead levels, PFAS clusters, or silent dangers
- **Environmental advocacy** — map water quality disparities across income or racial demographics
- **Home buying tools** — give prospective buyers a water quality signal before closing
- **Public health dashboards** — embed ZipCheckup data alongside other environmental indicators
- **Regulatory research** — compare state MCL enforcement against federal standards

## Data Sources & Methodology

**Primary sources:**
- [EPA Safe Drinking Water Information System (SDWIS)](https://www.epa.gov/enviro/sdwis-overview)
- [EPA ECHO enforcement database](https://echo.epa.gov/)
- Consumer Confidence Reports (CCR) — utility-submitted annual reports
- State MCL databases: CA, NJ, MA, NH, VT, CT, HI, NM

**ZIP-to-system matching:** EPA GEOGRAPHIC_AREA records and the `zipcodes` npm package. Some ZIPs are served by multiple systems; the record reflects the primary system by population served.

**Home Safety Score** is a composite 0–100 score that penalizes health-based violations, unresolved violations, lead exceedances, and contaminant count. A grade of A–F is assigned from the score. Full methodology: [zipcheckup.com/about/home-safety-score/](https://zipcheckup.com/about/home-safety-score/)

**CCR pipeline:** Consumer Confidence Reports are fetched from EPA's CCR website, parsed for contaminant tables, cross-referenced against SDWIS PWSID records, and matched to ZIP codes via the GEOGRAPHIC_AREA table.

**Anomaly detection:** Rule-based + threshold detection over the full SDWIS + ECHO + PFAS + Census dataset. Each anomaly is scored for severity (1–10) and interestingness.

**L3 metrics:** Derived from SDWIS + FEMA National Flood Insurance Program data + Census ACS income data + BLS regional utility rate data.

**Limitations:**
- ZIP-to-water-system matching is approximate; some ZIPs are served by multiple systems
- Lead/copper levels reflect 90th percentile tap sampling, not point-of-use measurements
- Radon is county-level, not measured at the address level
- CCR data reflects utility-reported levels, which may lag actual conditions
- State MCL crossref covers only states with confirmed stricter-than-federal limits
- Data lags EPA SDWIS by up to 24 hours
